                    <h2>Сheetah</h2>
                    <p>Noticeably different from other felines. The body is slender, with well-developed muscles and almost no fat deposits, it even seems fragile. The cheetah has a small head, high-set eyes and small rounded ears - that is, an aerodynamic body structure that serves for better aerodynamics during high-speed running. Also, the cheetah has a large chest and lungs, which also contributes to intensive breathing during high-speed running. The color is sandy yellow, with small black spots scattered all over the body, thin black stripes on the sides of the muzzle. The weight of an adult cheetah is between 40 and 65 kilograms, the body length is between 115 and 140 centimeters, and the rather massive tail is up to 80 centimeters long. The height at the withers is on average 75 to 90 centimeters. While running at maximum speed, his body temperature becomes equal to 40-42 degrees.</p>

                    <p>Unlike other felines, cheetahs hunt by stalking prey rather than ambushing. First, they approach the chosen victim at a distance of about 100 (or less) meters, not forgetting about stealth, and then try to catch it in a short high-speed run. In pursuit of the victim, they develop a speed of up to 120 km/h, accelerating to 90 km/h in 3 seconds. A cheetah runs in jumps 6-8 meters long, spending less than 0.5 seconds on each jump. Such jumps allow him to have a flexible spine that can be compressed and stretched. This is also influenced by the fact that 60% of the muscles are concentrated around the spine. During a sprint race, the cheetah's breathing rate increases to 150 times per minute [13]. Cheetah is also able to quickly change the direction of running. When running, the cheetah's claws act like spikes on boots. In the eyes, the zone of clear visibility passes in a continuous horizontal strip so that the prey is not lost sight of when it turns sharply to the side (sharp high-speed turns are a fairly effective and often used way for ungulates to break away from the pursuit of a predator). The cheetah usually knocks its prey off its feet with a blow of its front paw, using a sharp rudimentary claw, and then strangles it. The kinetic energy carried by the body of a cheetah jumping at a very high speed helps knock down a larger and heavier animal than itself. A cheetah's sprint lasts a maximum of 30 seconds at a distance of no more than 400 meters. Such a jerk requires such a consumption of oxygen from the muscles that the intensively working heart and even the voluminous lungs of a cheetah cannot compensate. And if the victim cannot be found in the first hundreds of meters, the cheetah simply stops the pursuit[14]. Despite the high speed, the animal pursued by the cheetah only becomes its prey in half of the cases. In Africa, the cheetah is the weakest of the large predators. Hyenas, leopards, and lions often take prey from cheetahs [15], often taking advantage of their inability to fight and long rest after a run (up to half an hour). The cheetah eats only those animals that it has killed, sometimes it drags its prey into the bushes to hide it from other predators, and it finishes eating later, but more often it hunts every time anew.</p>
                    <p>Cheetahs are diurnal predators. They hunt mainly medium-sized ungulates: gazelles, impalas, wildebeest calves, as well as hares. A cheetah can defeat an ostrich. 87% of the cheetah's prey is Thomson's gazelle. In Asia, gazelle was the main prey of the cheetah. Cheetahs hunt in the morning or in the evening, when it is not too hot, but thanks to the "tear strips" that absorb sunlight, they can hunt with the same success during the day, while other predators sit in shelters. They are oriented more by sight than by smell.</p>
